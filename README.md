Hi, I’m a student with an unrestrained passion for AI and web development—because who doesn’t want their code to be smarter than themselves? My toolkit includes C, Java (intermediate level—still not dreaming in curly braces), Python, and data visualization wizardry with Excel. I’m also quite friendly with VS Code and various AI tools (they haven’t replaced me… yet).

Currently, I’m channeling my inner data whisperer by working on cervical cancer prediction using deep learning—trying to make a real impact, one neural network at a time.

When I’m not debugging code or vibing out with some late-night coding sessions, you’ll probably find me on the basketball court, pretending the hoop is a stack overflow error I desperately need to clear.

I love connecting with cool projects and people—if your idea vibes with me, I just might connect (no pressure, but make it interesting 😏).
Let’s build something awesome (or at least something that compiles)!

Check out my LinkedIn—promise it’s more interesting than your average profile.

Other hobbies include questionable karaoke, spontaneous brainstorming
