Hi, I‚Äôm a student with an unrestrained passion for AI and web development‚Äîbecause who doesn‚Äôt want their code to be smarter than themselves? My toolkit includes C, Java (intermediate level‚Äîstill not dreaming in curly braces), Python, and data visualization wizardry with Excel. I‚Äôm also quite friendly with VS Code and various AI tools (they haven‚Äôt replaced me‚Ä¶ yet).

Currently, I‚Äôm channeling my inner data whisperer by working on cervical cancer prediction using deep learning‚Äîtrying to make a real impact, one neural network at a time.

When I‚Äôm not debugging code or vibing out with some late-night coding sessions, you‚Äôll probably find me on the basketball court, pretending the hoop is a stack overflow error I desperately need to clear.

I love connecting with cool projects and people‚Äîif your idea vibes with me, I just might connect (no pressure, but make it interesting üòè).
Let‚Äôs build something awesome (or at least something that compiles)!

Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naveen-vaidani-6ba573336/) ‚Äîpromise it‚Äôs more interesting than your average profile.

Other hobbies include questionable karaoke, spontaneous brainstorming
